# Temperature Control System

This repository contains all of the schematics for a temperature regulating system using a PID controller with an FIR filter and a passive low pass filter. Along with this the folder also contains a picture of the block diagram titled simulation.png. Finally the folder contains a picture of some sample data acquired from Realterm with the system holding at a given temperature.  

Below is the link to the Google Drive which contains the video presenation required after the live demo.
