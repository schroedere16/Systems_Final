# Temperature Control System

This repository contains  a folder with all of the schematics for a temperature regulating system using a PID controller with an FIR filter and a passive low pass filter. The folder also contains a picture of the block diagram titled simulation.png that was used in simulations to determine the PID coefficiants. Finally the folder contains a picture of some sample data acquired from Realterm with the system holding at a given temperature.  

Along with all of the schematics this repo contains the main.c file used on the MSP430F5529. This also contains a link to a video presenation of the project along with a copy of the report for this project. 

Below is the link to the Google Drive which contains the video presenation required after the live demo.
